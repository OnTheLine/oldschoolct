But I think you can still sort of see how it looks. The plaque is on the front of the building, which has been converted into condos. (One seems to be for sale, if anyone's interested! The address is 5 Candlewood Hill Rd.) The plaque says Higganum West, but this was once called the Green School because it replaced an earlier school building that stood on the nearby Higganum Green. Confusingly, some websites call this the ""Old Green School"" and say it was built in the 1840s. Also confusingly, another school - the Higganum Union School - is also said to have replaced the original Green School. This contradictory information is all just fun for an Instagram picture, but if I were writing a newspaper article or book about old schools I think Haddam would be one town that would drive me nuts:). #higganum #higganumct #haddam #haddamct #ct #Connecticut #cthistory #newengland #newenglandhistory #oldschool #oldschoolhouse #schoolhouse","Higganum West School House, Haddam",41.4970432,-72.5570348

Originally on Taugwonk Road, it was moved to its present Main Street location in the early 1980s. It stands on the foundation of a different one-room schoolhouse on the grounds of the 1819 Andrew Baldwin House. Also on the property: a blacksmith shop, carriage house, and waterwheel. The New York Times told the story of the schoolhouse in 1987 when then-owners Frank and Anna Limpert put the house up for sale: ""To furnish the schoolhouse, the Limperts used as a guide a photograph they received from Marcia Bentley Thompson, a North Stonington resident now in her 90's. The photograph shows Mrs. Thompson, then Miss Bentley, on her first day as a teacher, in 1911, at a one-room school in Clarks Falls, to the east. The Limperts found old desks in Rhode Island and inkwells in and along the Shunuck, just outside the schoolhouse windows. In 1983, when the restoration was complete, they named it the Marcia Thompson Schoolhouse and held ''Marcia Thompson Day.'' ''We invited all the one-room teachers we could find,'' said Mr. Limpert. Mrs. Thompson, sitting at the teacher's desk, joined several other former teachers in such activities as singing old school songs. Today, Mrs. Thompson's Bible sits, at her request, on the teacher's desk under pictures of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln but not far from the colorful crayon drawings of the schoolhouse made by children from the North Stonington Elementary School."" The house, schoolhouse included, is now on the market again: http://www.zillow.com/homedetails/63-Main-St-North-Stonington-CT-06359/59973800_zpid/#northstonington #northstoningtonct #ct #Connecticut #cthistory #newengland #newenglandhistory #oldschool #oldschoolhouse #oneroomschool #schoolhouse #oneroomschoolhouse","Marcia Thompson Schoolhouse, North Stonington",41.4409323,-71.8811827

The State of Connecticut Judicial Branch says: ""The Litchfield Law School, the first of its kind in the United States, was founded by Tapping Reeve in 1784. The custom for students of law in the 18th century was to be tutored privately or serve under apprenticeships. Tapping Reeve, after being admitted to the bar, began his instruction in this fashion teaching individuals in his living room. He developed a curriculum of all areas of the law and allowed students to operate a Moot Court. Eventually, Reeve constructed a school next to his home to accommodate the growing enrollment. He operated the school single-handedly until 1798 when he was appointed as a judge to the Superior Court. He then invited a partner, James Gould, to join him at the school.Distinguished alumni of the school included several Vice Presidents of the United States, as well as numerous Senators, Congressmen, Cabinet Ministers, Governors, and Judges."" For more, see https://www.jud.ct.gov/lawlib/history/tappingreeve.htmToday, the Tapping Reeve House and Law School are managed by the Litchfield Historical Society, and open to the public:http://www.litchfieldhistoricalsociety.org/lawschool/index.phpAnd yes, this is where Aaron Burr first studied law, though not in this schoolhouse. As one of Tapping Reeve's first students, Burr - brother of Reeve's wife Sally - hadmoved on years before the school itself was built.

The school district's name came from the nearby Wilmington Glass Company or West Willington Glassworks. To quote glassmuseum.org, ""The first output of glass bottles consisted of inkwells, snuffs, demijohns, chestnuts and flasks including some pitkin types. There were reportedly a few rare sealed bottles as well. As far as we know, there were no marked bottles or flasks prior to 1849. From this date to 1872, demijohns dominated the sales with wines, some bitters and even a booze bottle cabin figural. Perhaps the most famous of the wares are the Willington gothic cathedral type pickle jars of varying sizes and colors. They also produced base-embossed cylindrical bottles (there are 9 variants known), varying sizes of berry bottles in olive amber and olive green colors, and of course, the popular Liberty Eagle marked flasks in 1/2 pint, pint & quart moulds. The Willington glassworks also produced utility bottles, insulator types, rolling pins and assorted tableware. The colors of the glass were similar to Pitkin's & Coventry's but the shades of greens are among the most beautiful glass ever produced in this country."" #willington #willingtonct #Connecticut #cthistory #newengland #newenglandhistory #oldschool #oldschoolhouse #schoolhouse","Glass Factory School Road, Willington",41.8731622,-72.2628452
