Built in 1850 or earlier. This one-room schoolhouse is hiding in plain sight in downtown Mystic, attached to a home on Gravel Street. I haven‚Äôt seen anything about what it was called or where it was originally located, but I‚Äôve read two vague timelines suggesting when it got here. One indicates it was built in 1850 and added on to the main house in the late 1800s. The other indicates it was attached to the main house in 1850, which obviously would mean it had been used as a schoolhouse for some time before that. (I did find that the main house was built in either 1810 or 1818, and a self-guided tour of the area from the Mystic River Historical Society says of the home, ‚Äúthere is purported to be a resident ghost, but she is old and means no harm and gives no trouble.‚Äù) Today, the schoolhouse is a 1 bed 1 bath cottage, and visitors can rent it out. Which I‚Äôm now vaguely contemplating, even though I live less than 20 minutes awayüòÇ #mysticct #ct #Connecticut #cthistory #newengland #newenglandhistory #oldschool #oldschoolhouse #oneroomschool #schoolhouse #oneroomschoolhouse","Former schoolhouse, Mystic",,,

(See previous post.) The school district's name came from the nearby Wilmington Glass Company or West Willington Glassworks. To quote glassmuseum.org, ""The first output of glass bottles consisted of inkwells, snuffs, demijohns, chestnuts and flasks including some pitkin types. There were reportedly a few rare sealed bottles as well. As far as we know, there were no marked bottles or flasks prior to 1849. From this date to 1872, demijohns dominated the sales with wines, some bitters and even a booze bottle cabin figural. Perhaps the most famous of the wares are the Willington gothic cathedral type pickle jars of varying sizes and colors. They also produced base-embossed cylindrical bottles (there are 9 variants known), varying sizes of berry bottles in olive amber and olive green colors, and of course, the popular Liberty Eagle marked flasks in 1/2 pint, pint & quart moulds. The Willington glassworks also produced utility bottles, insulator types, rolling pins and assorted tableware. The colors of the glass were similar to Pitkin's & Coventry's but the shades of greens are among the most beautiful glass ever produced in this country."" #willington #willingtonct

Built in 1784. Yes, a it's one-room law schoolhouse. 
The State of Connecticut Judicial Branch says: ""The Litchfield Law School, the first of its kind in the United States, was founded by Tapping Reeve in 1784. The custom for students of law in the 18th century was to be tutored privately or serve under apprenticeships. Tapping Reeve, after being admitted to the bar, began his instruction in this fashion teaching individuals in his living room. He developed a curriculum of all areas of the law and allowed students to operate a Moot Court. Eventually, Reeve constructed a school next to his home to accommodate the growing enrollment. He operated the school single-handedly until 1798 when he was appointed as a judge to the Superior Court. He then invited a partner, James Gould, to join him at the school.

Distinguished alumni of the school included several Vice Presidents of the United States, as well as numerous Senators, Congressmen, Cabinet Ministers, Governors, and Judges."" For more, see https://www.jud.ct.gov/lawlib/history/tappingreeve.htm

Today, the Tapping Reeve House and Law School are managed by the Litchfield Historical Society, and open to the public:

http://www.litchfieldhistoricalsociety.org/lawschool/index.php

And yes, this is where Aaron Burr first studied law, though not in this schoolhouse. As one of Tapping Reeve's first students, Burr - brother of Reeve's wife Sally - had
moved on years before the school itself was built.

Built in 1814. This one looks basic but has a very cool backstory. Originally on Taugwonk Road, it was moved to its present Main Street location in the early 1980s. It stands on the foundation of a different one-room schoolhouse on the grounds of the 1819 Andrew Baldwin House. Also on the property: a blacksmith shop, carriage house, and waterwheel. The New York Times told the story of the schoolhouse in 1987 when then-owners Frank and Anna Limpert put the house up for sale: ""To furnish the schoolhouse, the Limperts used as a guide a photograph they received from Marcia Bentley Thompson, a North Stonington resident now in her 90's. The photograph shows Mrs. Thompson, then Miss Bentley, on her first day as a teacher, in 1911, at a one-room school in Clarks Falls, to the east. 
The Limperts found old desks in Rhode Island and inkwells in and along the Shunuck, just outside the schoolhouse windows. In 1983, when the restoration was complete, they named it the Marcia Thompson Schoolhouse and held ''Marcia Thompson Day.'' ''We invited all the one-room teachers we could find,'' said Mr. Limpert. Mrs. Thompson, sitting at the teacher's desk, joined several other former teachers in such activities as singing old school songs. Today, Mrs. Thompson's Bible sits, at her request, on the teacher's desk under pictures of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln but not far from the colorful crayon drawings of the schoolhouse made by children from the North Stonington Elementary School."" The house, schoolhouse included, is now on the market again: http://www.zillow.com/homedetails/63-Main-St-North-Stonington-CT-06359/59973800_zpid/

I don't post many of them here, but sometimes one just strikes me as cool, visually. This one is located not far from where I live, but I'd never realized it was a former school till the other day.

""From its opening in 1832 until 1848, the school was run by trustees and they kept the fees modest: English, $3.25 per semester; for Chemistry, Philosophy and Astronomy, $3.75; for French, $4.25; for Latin, Greek and higher branches of Mathematics, $4.75. There were additional fees for classes in music, painting, and other foreign languages. By 1848, prices had only risen by 25 cents per course. In that same year, when the trustees decided to lease the school to Lucius Lyon, a condition of the lease was that the rates must remain the same throughout the ten-year lease period.""

Built in 1998. The District Schoolhouse for Colored Children, which stood near the town green in Colchester, was established in 1803. It was the earliest ""attempt in Connecticut to provide educational opportunities specifically for African American youth,"" according to the Connecticut Freedom Trail. (For more, see ctfreedomtrail.org.) The teachers were African American as well. (For more on the teachers and students, see this 1998 story from the Day: https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1915&dat=19980828&id=R5ZGAAAAIBAJ&sjid=dPgMAAAAIBAJ&pg=5708,5594279&hl=en.) The original schoolhouse can be seen in a sketch that John Warner Barber made for his 1836 ""Historical Collections of Connecticut."" (See Wikipedia's ""Colchester, Connecticut"" page.) The building pictured here is about half the size of the original schoolhouse. The interior, a replica of a 19th century classroom, was constructed by students and faculty of Colchester schools. The building itself was provided by a local purveyor of sheds and gazebos. It opened in conjunction with Colchester's 300th anniversary. The building, and a historic marker explaining its significance, is located on Route 85 near Bacon Academy. #colchester #colchesterct #ctfreedomtrail #blackhistory #ct #Connecticut #cthistory #newengland #newenglandhistory #oldschool #oldschoolhouse #oneroomschool #schoolhouse #oneroomschool #oneroomschoolhouse #ctvisit","School for Colored Children, Colchester",,,

The plaque is on the front of the building, which has been converted into condos. (One seems to be for sale, if anyone's interested! The address is 5 Candlewood Hill Rd.) The plaque says Higganum West, but this was once called the Green School because it replaced an earlier school building that stood on the nearby Higganum Green. Confusingly, some websites call this the ""Old Green School"" and say it was built in the 1840s. Also confusingly, another school - the Higganum Union School - is also said to have replaced the original Green School. This contradictory information is all just fun for an Instagram picture, but if I were writing a newspaper article or book about old schools I think Haddam would be one town that would drive me nuts:). #higganum #higganumct #haddam #haddamct #ct #Connecticut #cthistory #newengland #newenglandhistory #oldschool #oldschoolhouse #schoolhouse","Higganum West School House, Haddam",,,
