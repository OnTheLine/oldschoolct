"Mill District School, Clinton. Built c. 1882. It has a large modern addition in the back, which is partially visible here. It was previously used for town offices, and is now privately owned. I learned about this one when it was posted recently by @strolling_the_shoreline (thank you for the tip!)

"Clarence R. O’Crowley Schoolhouse, Coventry. Built in ????. (If you know, please let me know in the comments!) Located on the grounds of the Nathan Hale Homestead, this schoolhouse is named for a former educator at the museum who died in 2013. The museum uses the building in their Colonial Camp program. Here’s a description of what they do there, from the website of Connecticut Landmarks: “Students experience 18th-century school life in our one room schoolhouse. They will participate in 18th-century lesson plans including figuring arithmetic on slate boards. Students will learn how strict an 18th-century classroom could be but will also have the opportunity to enjoy recess using 18th-century  toys such as graces, Jacob’s ladder and wooden hoops.” #coventry #coventryct #ct #Connecticut #cthistory #newengland #newenglandhistory #oldschool #oldschoolhouse #oneroomschool #schoolhouse #oneroomschoolhouse",8/14/19 22:19,https://scontent-lhr3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e35/s1080x1080/66623024_499045017547309_4159498190127884278_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-lhr3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&oh=e1684524b6415d26267238c420484463&oe=5E7B04FD,66623024_499045017547309_4159498190127884278_n.jpg,instagram.com/p/B1KTGz0JIWj,"Clarence R.

"Union District School, South Windsor. Built c. 1905, with additional changes made to the building between 1911 and 1920. This is what you get when several smaller district schools are consolidated. In South Windsor, that happened in 1901. After Districts 1 - 4 were merged into the Union District, the town purchased land on Main Street for this school building.

"Workmen’s Circle Building, New London. Built in 1929. This is, obviously, a church today. It’s been home to various churches since about 1940. But originally, it was the community building and school of Branch 109 of the Workmen’s Circle (Arbiter Ring), a Jewish cultural organization founded in 1892. (The New London branch was started in 1907.) Their first school was located on Tilley Street, but they soon moved to this building, on Jefferson Avenue. Founded by Jewish immigrants to America, the Workmen’s Circle focused on education and the fight for worker’s rights. In its schools, which children attended after regular public school classes, kids 8 and older were taught to speak and read Yiddish. They would also perform Yiddish-language plays.

"Former Schoolhouse, Washington. Built c. 1850. It is, or was until recently, a private home; it appeared in the Wall Street Journal in November 2017, with photos showing the ($$$) renovated interior and additions.

You can’t tell from this angle, but it’s been completely gutted and there’s construction equipment parked all around. The additions seemed to me to be gone.

From one document about early Thompson schools, which did not help me with the date question, I learned that “No girl was thought to have thoroughly learned the alphabet until she had acquired the art of affixing each separate letter perfectly upon an elaborate sampler.” Better than kickball, I guess. #thompsonct #ct #Connecticut #cthistory #newengland #newenglandhistory #oldschool #oldschoolhouse #schoolhouse",10/15/18 12:08,https://scontent-lhr3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e35/43779525_319282962192799_2057908740011960780_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-lhr3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=107&oh=a64a95eb8249050f453f0c33793ba343&oe=5E6D25F1,43779525_319282962192799_2057908740011960780_n.jpg,instagram.com/p/Bo9ASOCBeAa,"Academy Building, Thompson","[41.9380922, -71.9000762]",41.93809,-71.90008

"Former Woodmont schoolhouse, Milford. Built in 1960. (Sorry for the poor quality pic; I took this years ago before I had any idea this building had once been a schoolhouse!) This two-room school was built as a portable classroom. It was moved to its current location on Clinton Street in 1976. The building was then used as the Woodmont Borough Hall until the borough’s government moved into a former firehouse. The old school, now zoned as a single-family home, was put up for auction in 2016. At the time, the Borough warden stated it had “no historic value.” Sad trombone. #woodmontct #milfordct #ct #Connecticut #cthistory #newengland #newenglandhistory #oldschool #oldschoolhouse #tworoomschoolhouse #schoolhouse",8/27/18 13:02,https://scontent-lhr3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e35/39326309_652527208465980_6473832108320956859_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-lhr3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&oh=ad8eee8b2b6f1b7be222a9e48357532b&oe=5E738767,39326309_652527208465980_6473832108320956859_n.jpg,instagram.com/p/Bm-7f7Vh0SF,"Former Woodmont schoolhouse, Milford","[41.223724, -72.99753]",41.22372,-72.99753

"Glass Factory School Road, Willington. (See previous post.) The school district's name came from the nearby Wilmington Glass Company or West Willington Glassworks. To quote glassmuseum.org, ""The first output of glass bottles consisted of inkwells, snuffs, demijohns, chestnuts and flasks including some pitkin types. There were reportedly a few rare sealed bottles as well. As far as we know, there were no marked bottles or flasks prior to 1849. From this date to 1872, demijohns dominated the sales with wines, some bitters and even a booze bottle cabin figural. Perhaps the most famous of the wares are the Willington gothic cathedral type pickle jars of varying sizes and colors. They also produced base-embossed cylindrical bottles (there are 9 variants known), varying sizes of berry bottles in olive amber and olive green colors, and of course, the popular Liberty Eagle marked flasks in 1/2 pint, pint & quart moulds. The Willington glassworks also produced utility bottles, insulator types, rolling pins and assorted tableware. The colors of the glass were similar to Pitkin's & Coventry's but the shades of greens are among the most beautiful glass ever produced in this country."" #willington #willingtonct

That's a private elementary school held in the home of a female teacher, and not, sadly, a place where you go to study how to be a dame.

"Litchfield Law School, Litchfield. Built in 1784. Yes, a it's one-room law schoolhouse. 
The State of Connecticut Judicial Branch says: ""The Litchfield Law School, the first of its kind in the United States, was founded by Tapping Reeve in 1784. The custom for students of law in the 18th century was to be tutored privately or serve under apprenticeships. Tapping Reeve, after being admitted to the bar, began his instruction in this fashion teaching individuals in his living room. He developed a curriculum of all areas of the law and allowed students to operate a Moot Court. Eventually, Reeve constructed a school next to his home to accommodate the growing enrollment. He operated the school single-handedly until 1798 when he was appointed as a judge to the Superior Court. He then invited a partner, James Gould, to join him at the school.

Distinguished alumni of the school included several Vice Presidents of the United States, as well as numerous Senators, Congressmen, Cabinet Ministers, Governors, and Judges."" For more, see https://www.jud.ct.gov/lawlib/history/tappingreeve.htm

Today, the Tapping Reeve House and Law School are managed by the Litchfield Historical Society, and open to the public:

http://www.litchfieldhistoricalsociety.org/lawschool/index.php

And yes, this is where Aaron Burr first studied law, though not in this schoolhouse. As one of Tapping Reeve's first students, Burr - brother of Reeve's wife Sally - had
moved on years before the school itself was built.

"Marcia Thompson Schoolhouse, North Stonington. Built in 1814. This one looks basic but has a very cool backstory. Originally on Taugwonk Road, it was moved to its present Main Street location in the early 1980s. It stands on the foundation of a different one-room schoolhouse on the grounds of the 1819 Andrew Baldwin House. Also on the property: a blacksmith shop, carriage house, and waterwheel. The New York Times told the story of the schoolhouse in 1987 when then-owners Frank and Anna Limpert put the house up for sale: ""To furnish the schoolhouse, the Limperts used as a guide a photograph they received from Marcia Bentley Thompson, a North Stonington resident now in her 90's. The photograph shows Mrs. Thompson, then Miss Bentley, on her first day as a teacher, in 1911, at a one-room school in Clarks Falls, to the east. 
The Limperts found old desks in Rhode Island and inkwells in and along the Shunuck, just outside the schoolhouse windows. In 1983, when the restoration was complete, they named it the Marcia Thompson Schoolhouse and held ''Marcia Thompson Day.'' ''We invited all the one-room teachers we could find,'' said Mr. Limpert. Mrs. Thompson, sitting at the teacher's desk, joined several other former teachers in such activities as singing old school songs. Today, Mrs. Thompson's Bible sits, at her request, on the teacher's desk under pictures of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln but not far from the colorful crayon drawings of the schoolhouse made by children from the North Stonington Elementary School."" The house, schoolhouse included, is now on the market again: http://www.zillow.com/homedetails/63-Main-St-North-Stonington-CT-06359/59973800_zpid/

Their website discusses something that's not often included in records of early Connecticut education: its cost. ""From its opening in 1832 until 1848, the school was run by trustees and they kept the fees modest: English, $3.25 per semester; for Chemistry, Philosophy and Astronomy, $3.75; for French, $4.25; for Latin, Greek and higher branches of Mathematics, $4.75. There were additional fees for classes in music, painting, and other foreign languages. By 1848, prices had only risen by 25 cents per course. In that same year, when the trustees decided to lease the school to Lucius Lyon, a condition of the lease was that the rates must remain the same throughout the ten-year lease period.""

"School for Colored Children, Colchester. Built in 1998. The District Schoolhouse for Colored Children, which stood near the town green in Colchester, was established in 1803. It was the earliest ""attempt in Connecticut to provide educational opportunities specifically for African American youth,"" according to the Connecticut Freedom Trail. (For more, see ctfreedomtrail.org.) The teachers were African American as well. (For more on the teachers and students, see this 1998 story from the Day: https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1915&dat=19980828&id=R5ZGAAAAIBAJ&sjid=dPgMAAAAIBAJ&pg=5708,5594279&hl=en.) The original schoolhouse can be seen in a sketch that John Warner Barber made for his 1836 ""Historical Collections of Connecticut."" (See Wikipedia's ""Colchester, Connecticut"" page.) The building pictured here is about half the size of the original schoolhouse. The interior, a replica of a 19th century classroom, was constructed by students and faculty of Colchester schools. The building itself was provided by a local purveyor of sheds and gazebos. It opened in conjunction with Colchester's 300th anniversary. The building, and a historic marker explaining its significance, is located on Route 85 near Bacon Academy. #colchester #colchesterct #ctfreedomtrail #blackhistory #ct #Connecticut #cthistory #newengland #newenglandhistory #oldschool #oldschoolhouse #oneroomschool #schoolhouse #oneroomschool #oneroomschoolhouse #ctvisit",10/6/15 16:14,https://scontent-lhr3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e35/12144129_1631772733741128_211442293_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-lhr3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&oh=2e77be065d266cb407e03bc1970582dc&oe=5E692C62,12144129_1631772733741128_211442293_n.jpg,instagram.com/p/8gKEkIoeYF,"School for Colored Children, Colchester","[41.5742016, -72.33349489999999]",41.5742,-72.33349

"Higganum West School House, Haddam. Built in 1858. I debated whether or not to post this because it's half covered by the leaves. But I think you can still sort of see how it looks. The plaque is on the front of the building, which has been converted into condos. (One seems to be for sale, if anyone's interested! The address is 5 Candlewood Hill Rd.) The plaque says Higganum West, but this was once called the Green School because it replaced an earlier school building that stood on the nearby Higganum Green. Confusingly, some websites call this the ""Old Green School"" and say it was built in the 1840s. Also confusingly, another school - the Higganum Union School - is also said to have replaced the original Green School. This contradictory information is all just fun for an Instagram picture, but if I were writing a newspaper article or book about old schools I think Haddam would be one town that would drive me nuts:). #higganum #higganumct #haddam #haddamct #ct #Connecticut #cthistory #newengland #newenglandhistory #oldschool #oldschoolhouse #schoolhouse",7/8/15 15:36,https://scontent-lhr3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e35/10844135_1152807924745217_1575566291_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-lhr3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&oh=6fcd31598b596827c424d177f725fed0&oe=5E7E082E,10844135_1152807924745217_1575566291_n.jpg,instagram.com/p/44WKUkIeUW,"Higganum West School House, Haddam","[41.4970432, -72.5570348]",41.49704,-72.55703

"Rimmon School House, Beacon Falls. Built in 1779. This was the schoolhouse that sparked my interest in these little buildings. (Not the first I ever saw - there was one in the town where I grew up, Adams Academy in Westport, posted here a few weeks back.) I was researching a story about day trip options in the Valley and when I came across this building I knew I had to include it. After that, I began noticing other schoolhouses everywhere I went. Last I heard, the Rimmon School was in bad shape physically and its new owners didn't much care what happened to it. Hopefully that's no longer the case. #beaconfalls #beaconfallsct #ct #Connecticut #cthistory #oldschool #oldschoolhouse #schoolhouse #oneroomschool #oneroomschoolhouse",6/11/15 10:53,https://scontent-lhr3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e15/11325233_1717274398499950_1585028135_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-lhr3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110&oh=495e66f2b56f4609673e62e1f287b052&oe=5E69579F,11325233_1717274398499950_1585028135_n.jpg,instagram.com/p/3yUXWUIeaZ,"Rimmon School House, Beacon Falls","[41.4240072, -73.0830221]",41.42401,-73.08302
